## Site recommendation

This section is based on a post published on [our blog](https://gwst.eu/) and is a subjective commentary on the work "The Age of Humanity: Towards the Fifth Industrial Revolution", beautifully written by the great Marc Vidal, so we remain open to your opinions and comments.

As we always do, we encourage you to buy the author's work, read it and give your opinion for yourself, from the original source.

## Summary

### 4th RI

First of all, the arrival of the **5th RI** is imminent and, therefore, urgent attention. In other words, **the 4th RI, which we live in now, is just the prelude** to another far-reaching transformation.

### Transition

As a result of the impending change, we must all, to a greater or lesser extent, inevitably change around the following concepts:

* _**Tax model**_ : That hinders social inequalities, that is, that prevents the _**total destruction of the middle classes**_ .
* _**Educational model**_ : _**The**_ [_**Learnability**_](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aprendibilidad) in the modification process _**\(relocation of labor standards\)**_ , the integration of new tools such as AI, the big data, automation and the development of new personal skills _**will have more work but very different .**_
* _**New social contract**_ : The new **social contract** is “ **employment** ” and will be _**very different and very scarce**_ , that is, the option of _**living without working or doing so in another way**_ is predictable.
* _**Basic income**_ : We assume the _**basic income**_ and also _**must be universal is**_ \(everywhere\). The example of failure in Switzerland proves it to us, for example.
* _**Common space**_ : A _**new \(common\) space**_ must be generated _**between companies, people and machines**_ as a result of automation, AI, etc.

Decisions to be taken as a result of the need to generate _**opportunities for the technology sector**_ :

* _**Lower taxes.**_
* _**Facilitate the creation of innovative businesses**_ .
* _**Connect training with demand**_ .
* _**Do not punish international investment**_ .

### Transition

The _**coming monumental crisis may be**_ an _opportunity for transformation **into the age of mankind**_ , but it can also be a _**disaster of biblical proportions**_ if the right actions are not taken.

In the digital economy, the author reviews specific experiences, but above all focusing on _**the collaborative economy**_ and _**the paradigm shift that involves owning objects to rent services**_ .

To prevent the "bad judgments of AI", researchers _**Marcos Riedl and Brent Harrison**_ of the Georgia Institute of Technology \(USA\) created a _**software model called "Don Quixote"**_ , capable of aligning concepts through 'acceptable stories and sequences that generate understanding _**in an AI and it understands how to behave correctly \(ethically\), in a human environment**_ .

Now, _**growing up and doing things right are not synonymous**_.

_**Face-to-face business does not preclude the existence of an online**_ \(scalable\) business, but all in all, it _**can only work if the customer is at the center of the value chain.**_

We must not _**"recover anything"**_ , but we must _**"build a better future"**_.

In _**Ireland 146 startups**_ are created _**daily**_, in _**Dublin 10% of employees**_ are _**computer developers**_.

### Inequalities

_**The unequal situation of women**_, not only in the technology sector but in leadership positions in general, _**is a problem of cultural origin that will not be easy to overcome**_. At these crucial times, _**it does not seem that we are in a position that it is mostly men who are managing change**_ towards the age of humanity, nor do we need to settle for quotas. _**The traffic towards the 5th. RI should not be handled mostly by men.**_

Poverty has reached the level of creating " _**poor wage earners**_ ."

### Sectors

_**The primary sector**_ . With an arable area of ​​just an additional four percent, as a result it will be under greater pressure than it has ever had with two billion more mouths to feed, in the next thirty years.

_**The fintech**_. The financial industry applies new technologies, and new payment systems, as a result, will lead us _**to a more customer-centric banking and personalized digital experience**_, _**less banking \(Bank or iBank\) and more service \(iMoney\), fewer costs, and more business relationship with the customer.**_

_**Builders**_: They will be virtual spaces as a result of the failure of the traditional model.

_**Travel agencies, gyms**_: They will become virtual advisors of physical commitment, as a result of the need to become _**creators of experiences**_ for customers.

Retail: _**The “retail apocalypse” has begun**_ as a result of what Wallmart CEO said, “it is up to retailers to adapt to these changes and, in some areas, even lead the change, or else they will be left to fend for themselves. and they will disappear ”.

### Social protection

_**We are still not growing**_ in what needs to grow, in innovation and technological readiness. _**Pensions and the cohabitation model are at stake.**_

In the future, there will be no more secure jobs. _**It's time to reinvent yourself every so often**_.

The _**company**_ \(soon\) should think about how to _**restructure**_ when _**there is no work, such as we know it.**_

_**In Spain, youth unemployment is unprecedented**_.

The _**"electronic persons"**_ could _**pay our pensions**_.

The _**basic income will not**_ be given to an _**"idle world"**_ , but to a _**"world without jobs"**_ . _**It will not**_ represent _**"uniformity"**_ or the _**loss**_ of _**"private initiative**_. _**"**_

_**"What scares me is not the new technologies, but the old ones"**_ \(union leader in Sweden\).

In the future, _**working two hours a day will be enough**_.

The _**83% of the work done by people who earn less than € 18 / hour have already started automation**_.

The _**change affects 60% of current employment**_.

### 5th RI

“ _**Industry 5.0**_ ” and “ _**society 5.0**_ ” are _**inseparable**_.

It will be characterized by _**three types of integration**_ :

* _**Economic**_: It will affect all production services.
* _**Social**_: Social and political planning that will reduce social gaps.
* _**Environmental**_: It will reduce the human ecological footprint.

_**Combining “properly human” managerial skills**_ \(such as critical thinking, negotiation, and creativity\) _**with understanding digital language, or understanding the limits of artificial intelligence “will succeed in making companies better and more technologically human. »**_, That is, it _**will completely change the way companies relate to consumers**_ \(by re-evaluating the human factor\).

There will be _**free training.**_ There will be new ways to learn. " _**We all need to become apprentices**_ ."

The _**future**_ is the cities, which will be _**City-States**_. We will have _**smart cities**_ that will _**compete for talent**_.

_**The connected factory is transformed into smart**_.

We will have _**a human brain in our pocket for less than € 1,000.**_

We will be _**8,000 M people interconnected**_ in the world.

_**It is in our hands to make the 5th I.R.**_ it is not the age of machines but the age of humanity.

_**The lessons**_ that we are internalizing by leaps and bounds with the _**Covid-19**_ crisis are _**accelerating us towards a more digital and more humane social and economic reality.**_

If we are not critical _**we can become "followers" of the post-truth**_.

Sometimes it seems that _**the "mass media" are turning us into "mass fools**_. _**"**_

### Some data and forecasts

_**2009**_: The Spanish _**biotechnology sector**_ is _**2.9% of GDP**_ in Spain.

_**2014**_: Sochi Winter Games _**VibraImage**_ was used\(to _**identify**_ visitors ’ _**facial expressions**_ \).

_**2015**_: Davos Forum, the term " _**Absolute Internet**_ " is created.

_**2016**_: Davos Forum, the term[ _**Learnability**_](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aprendibilidad) is created\(without investing there is no future\).

_**2018**_: _**29% of the activity was**_ done by _**robots**_.

_**2019**_: The Spanish _**biotechnology sector**_ is _**8.6% of GDP**_ in Spain. _**We need to promote it!**_.

_**2022: 42% of the activity was**_ done by _**robots**_.

_**2024: The manufacturer will be responsible for any car accident.**_ The _**robotics**_ industry _**reduces labor costs an 18.25%**_.

_**2025: More than 50 % of the activity was** done by **robots**_.

_**2027**_: _**The collaborative economy**_ will reach € 300,000 million.

_**2030**_: _**10 million vehicles, worldwide**_, dedicated to transport and logistics**, will** _**not need a driver**_. _**What we call the Internet will be "everything"**_, that is, _**everything will be connected to everything**_, something that can mean a huge _**liberation for human beings**_. The _**majority**_ of the _**workforce**_ will be _**"freelance"**_.

## Reader's conclusions

### Industrial Revolutions

**Four I.R.'s that have shaped today's world:**

[_**Industrial Revolutions**_](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revoluciones_industriales): It is the historiographical denomination of processes of technological revolution that take place in the Contemporary Age, carried out by the industry. They are not limited to economic change, but are the essential factor in the transition from a pre-industrial society to an industrial society, and then to post-industrial society and subsequent political changes.

_**1st RI \(1760-1830\)**_ : Key factor was that _**steam energy \(powered by coal\) was used**_ to develop work. Some authors place it between 1820 and 1840.

_**2nd RI \(1860-1914\)**_: Key factor was that _**electricity**_ was used to develop work. Some authors place it in the 1850s and 1950s and add new modes of transportation, the use of oil, and so on.

_**3rd RI \(1965-1990\)**_: Key factor was that _**computers**_ were used _**in industry**_ \(also industrial robots and other technologies\). This RI also called the Scientific-Technological Revolution \(RCT\), which was raised by[ Jeremy Rifkin](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Rifkin).

_**4th RI \(1990-…\)**_: Key factor in this \(which is the current RI\) is that the _**Internet**_ is used. For some authors, it is also crucial that Big Data, Robots \(collaborative\), AI, etc. are used.

### Digital transformation

A very important topic for this reader is the _**Digital Transformation**_ and how Marc Vidal describes it:

* _**Digitization**_: Application of some digital tools to jobs that were previously done manually, without changing anything else in the company.
* _**Digital transformation**_: Cultural transformation in the company based on _**the "engagement" of staff**_ \( _**extending the value chain and placing the customer at the center\), with a very deep technological fit, by all.**_

_**This would explain, perhaps, why technologies such as BI or DMS \(for example\) do not succeed in many companies**_ that return to work as many years ago.

_**Look at this video**_: [https://youtu.be/NeQ4eE1QVVU](https://youtu.be/NeQ4eE1QVVU)

### Fifth Industrial Revolution and Technological Singularity

_**5th RI \(perhaps it has already begun to take shape\): A**_ key factor in this RI is the _**"Technological Singularity"**_.

[_**ST**_](https://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singularitat_tecnol%C3%B2gica): _**It was first formulated**_ by[John von Neumann](https://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann) in the 1950s.

#### Evolution of the term Technological Singularity

**John von Neumann and Stanislaw M. Ulam**

[Stanislaw M. Ulam](https://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Ulam) \(Polish mathematician\), in a conversation with [John von Neumann](https://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann), speculated that due to the progress of technology - and the rapid change in our lives, it means -.

He concluded that there will be a point in the future at which we will not be able to be aware of what is happening, and here will appear what mathematicians call a _**singularity**_. [Stanislaw M. Ulam](https://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Ulam) participated in the [Manhattan Project](https://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projecte_Manhattan), as did [John von Neumann](https://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann).

**IJ Good and Vernor Vinge**

The English mathematician [IJ Good ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I._J._Good)_**used the term singularity**_ in 1965 until in 1980, computer scientist and writer [Vernor Vinge](https://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernor_Vinge) popularized it.

**Robert A. Wilson, the "Jumping Jesus" and Ray Kurzweil**

In 1986, writer [Robert A. Wilson](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Anton_Wilson) gave a 1-and-a-half-hour lecture called "The Acceleration of Knowledge," explaining his book "Right Where You Are Sitting Now." you are sitting now\). In this conference, he proposed the term "_**Jumping**_ _**Jesus**_".

Wilson proposed a new unit of measurement, 1j \(a “Jesus”\), which comprises the sum of known scientific facts in the year 1 AD, which bears the name of Jesus \(it has nothing to do with religion\). 

Wilson also proposed \(subjectively, of course\) that to reach 1j it took the estimated age of Homo sapiens \(40,000-100,000 years\).

Progression proposed by [Robert A. Wilson](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Anton_Wilson)

* 1d: 1 AD \(40,000-100,000 years\).
* 2 days: 1500 AD \(1500 years\).
* 4d: 1750 AD \(250 years\).
* 8 days: 1900 AD \(150 years\).
* 16d: 1950 AD \(50 years\).
* 32j: 1960 AD \(10 years\).
* 64j: 1967 AD \(7 years\).
* 128j: 1973 AD \(6 years\).
* 256j: 1978 AD \(5 years\).
* 512j: 1982 AD \(4 years\).
* x2j \(annual\): 2000 AD \(18 years\).

The “Jumping Jesus” exists as a footnote to several \(considerably more important\) works on _**singularity**_ theory, most notably [Ray Kurzweil](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Kurzweil) \(we will pass the [Turing](https://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing) test in 2029 and singularity around 2050\).

**Interpretation of the singularity by the reader**

My opinion is that the _**singularity**_, will be the moment in which the acceleration of the technological knowledge, will pass in a time -&gt; 0, that is to say, virtually the technological knowledge will tend to infinity, therefore, unattainable by Homo sapiens. The question I ask myself is: At this point will we no longer be human ?.

This reflection leads me to a metaphor \(if physicists allow me\). Let us imagine that the [_**ST**_](https://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singularitat_tecnol%C3%B2gica) is the physical singularity of a black hole. We know that there is a border where we can no longer go back to the road and very crazy things happen \(the event horizon\). Forgive physicists for my ignorance.

I think Marc Vidal's GREAT work is a desperate cry for us to reflect \(all, including politicians\) before we reach the horizon of events of the [_**ST**_](https://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singularitat_tecnol%C3%B2gica)_**.**_

### Conclusions

_**If we control this traffic then will be "the era of humanity"**_ as a result _**dep in each of us what will happen.**_

But remember: _**“Making predictions is very difficult, especially when it comes to the future”**_ \(Niels Bohr\).
